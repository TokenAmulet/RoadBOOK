Open the Browser section and find [PancakeSwap](https://pancakeswap.finance/swap) and open it. Connect your Metamask Wallet in the top-right. Scroll down a little to the "Exchange" box

Click the  icon and set the slippage to 12%. If you want to give it the best possible change to clear, increase the deadline. By default it should be set to 20 minutes, which is fine.

Once the slippage is set, and you have the BNB amount set that you wish to swap for Amulet as shown, just click Swap and wait patiently for the transaction to clear. This process may not be instant and can take anywhere from a few minutes up to an hour sometimes, depending on traffic.

Once the transaction has been cleared, you should have TokenAmulet in your MetaMask Wallet!
